            I've gained a lot of practical experience and become intimately familiar with several coding languages. Also, I participated in coding

                Avoid providing the hiring manager with an exact amount of money if possible. A set amount can give off the impression that you aren’t open

            I know the average salary for this type of entry-level position is in the $600 to $900 range. I think that I would be a great fit for the role
            due to my skills and knowledge, so I am expecting a salary within that range.

          <h3>example 2</h3>
          <p>
            Based on my research and with my experience and specific skills in JavaScript and CSS, I would expect to receive something in the range of $600
            to $900. However, I am willing to be flexible as I am really interested in working for your company in this role.

          <h3>example 1</h3>
          <p>
            The most important to me is learning new things. Learning something new is to me a life force. Knowing that every day I will be a little
            uncomfortable, helps me stay alert and keep moving. The best jobs demand more of me than what I think I can do and challenge my thinking. I
            definitely don’t want to be working in a job I can do without effort or thought

            I want to become a proficient frontend developer and start working with React. Also, I additionally want to study Vue.js, TypeScript,

            As I pursue a career advancement, I am looking forward to learning new skills and improving my knowledge. This year I am going to master
            front-end development. That’s why I have to get practical experience in React and Vue.js. And then, I am planning to advance my career as a
            fullstack developer. In a year, I want to start working with Node.js.

            My boss was strong-willed, which sometimes made it difficult to communicate new ideas. However, we always managed to talk it out and find
            solutions that were best for the company. He did not micro-manage each position and I was free to find my own approach to the tasks I was given

          <p>
            The most unacceptable for me at work is distrust. It causes an unhealthy working environment which leads to loss of efficiency and conflicts
            inside a team. The more transparent the work environment, the happier the employees are. The happier employees are, the more productive they
            are. Ultimately, honesty builds trust in the company and confidence in leadership. Trust is important for me as a common human value and it
            should be realised at work either

          <h2>What is your greatest weakness / strength?</h2>
          <h3>Weakness:</h3>
          <p>
            I think one area I could work on is my delegation skills. I spend more time than necessary by taking tasks personally that could easily be
            delegated to someone else. I have never missed a deadline but I realized that I can slow things down if I take all the tasks personally without
            delegating to others.
          </p>
          <h3>Strength:</h3>
          <p>
            One of my strengths is that I am passionate about learning new things. And I’ve always been very good at staying up to date. In my previous
            company, we used to spend a lot of time on manual testing. I have discussed with my manager and my team and implemented the automation process
            in one of our projects. The team was not happy with that sudden change from manual to automation process, but I managed to motivate them by
            holding regular updates and training.

            I want to start my career in an international company with a good reputation in the market. It is important for me to be able to grow
            professionally in my workplace, master new technologies and expand my stack. In the future, I want to be able to work remotely a few days a
            week, but for the probationary period I am ready to work in the office. It is important for me to be surrounded by like-minded professionals

            Last year I got a challenging task from my boss. For the last two quarters, I had to produce 8 new website pages. I divided the goal into
            smaller targets which made it easier for me to create the layout and content by the end of December. I made a schedule for what I could tackle
            each day. I completed the task successfully and got a promotion. Taking my work day by day and doing it segmented like that helps me reach
            deadlines.

          <p>
            I was working as a project manager for about a year when I got my first complex project. When I prepared the project schedule, I was too
            optimistic, and I didn’t include much time for unexpected issues that might arise. In the end, we had more problems than I had expected, and we
            ended up four weeks behind. The customer had to reschedule the launch date. My company lost part of its profit because of having to pay delay
            penalties. My error prompted me to seek an experienced colleague to mentor me. My mentor taught me how to handle scheduling better, gave me
            career advice, and helped me become a more efficient project manager.

          <h2>How do you think your previous experience will help in this role?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. Study the job description <br />
              <span>
                You can’t explain how your previous experience is relevant to an employer’s role if you don’t first understand the position and which
                skills an employer wants to see.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Review your experience and look for similarities <br />
              <span>
                Once you’ve reviewed the job description, it’s time to look back at your own experience (likely by reviewing your resume or LinkedIn
                profile) and think about what work experience you have that’s most similar to the employer’s needs.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Focus on your employer’s needs <br />
              <span>
                Researching the company and the role they are looking to fill is a good idea when preparing to answer a variety of interview questions.
                Hiring managers always appreciate a candidate who focuses on talking about their exact position and needs, rather than talking in general
                terms.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>example 1</h3>
          <p>
            As I mentioned in my resume, I worked as a stewardess. By looking at my years of experience of being in that position, I could confidently say
            that I have strong communication skills and know how to deal with conflict and stressful situations. Besides, at my previous job I
            significantly improved my English and broadened my horizons. I’m confident that this prior experience will help me step into this new position
            and be successful.
          </p>
          <h3>example 2</h3>
          <p>
            In my most recent role as an HR manager, I was in charge of arranging interviews, coordinating them, and onboarding new employees. I greatly
            improved my research skills and I am good at quickly finding necessary information. I know how important organized teamwork is and can build
            the process of effective communication. I think such work experience will help me in my career development inside your company.

          <h3>example</h3>
          <p>
            My last project was an application that tracks your personal finances. My main task was to create and configure a database, make the frontend
            component of the site, and connect the database to the frontend. In addition, I was to think through the logic of the behavior of the web
            application and correct data transfer from the frontend to the backend. Throughout the project, I faced the problem of making up a data storage
            structure so that it was correctly updated, supplemented and created. The project solves the problem of keeping record of your personal
            finances. Thanks to the application, you will always know how much money you have and how much you spend a month. The benefit of this project
            is that I created an application from scratch that is convenient for me personally. I can also see detailed statistics on expenses and income.

          <h2>Describe your working conditions now or in the previous workplace</h2>
          <h3>example 1</h3>
          <p>
            I work in a fairly traditional office environment doing a typical nine-to-five job. I like my job, but it’s annoying that my commute to work
            takes an hour and a half each way and most of my work could really be done remotely. But my boss doesn’t seem to trust that we will get any
            work done without being controlled, and everyone in the company has to clock in and out every day. It’s frustrating that they feel the need to
            monitor what we do so closely instead of judging us based on our task performance, like most companies do these days.
          </p>
          <h3>example 2</h3>
          <p>
            I work for a global IT company, but because their headquarters are in the States, I do all my work online from home. That means that I don’t
            waste time commuting or making idle chitchat with colleagues. I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it
            means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment
            with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a
            task. It can also get quite lonely working on my own, and I sometimes miss sharing ideas with colleagues

          <h2>What should you do to appear confident in an interview?</h2>
          <h3>Use these tips to impress interviewers with your confidence:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. Make eye contact <br />
              <span>
                To show confidence, start by practicing your eye contact. Keeping natural and steady eye contact throughout your interview is an excellent
                way to project confidence. Aim to maintain natural eye contact instead of making eye contact that feels intense. Try occasionally looking
                at your resume or other material you brought with you to the interview before turning your attention back to the hiring manager.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              2. Prepare and rehearse your answers <br />
              <span>
                One great way to showcase interview confidence is to prepare your answers to common interview questions. When you walk into an interview
                with the knowledge that you are prepared, it can take off the pressure and help you feel more confident. Consider sitting down with a
                friend or family member to think about your answers. They do not need to be memorized but aim to prepare enough so that you can produce
                responses you are proud of.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Take your time <br />
              <span>
                Speak calmly and slowly. To stop yourself from rambling, try to answer each question by addressing one point at a time. Confident people
                also tend to take their time when answering questions. If you feel like you need a moment to compose your thoughts, feel free to say, “That
                is a good question. Let me think about that for a second.” Also, do not be afraid to ask the interviewer for clarification of the question.
